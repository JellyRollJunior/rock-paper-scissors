- My first Javascript project :)
- Learning a bit about the peculiarities of JS. 
- Side Note: It seems I may have misunderstood the instructions in step 6:
  - "Move your playRound function and score variables so that theyâ€™re declared inside of the new playGame function"
  - I did not realize they meant literally move the whole playRound() declaration inside playGame()
    - This workflow is strange coming from a Java background so I did not realize that is what the instructions meant! I only realized it after looking at some solutions
    - Oh well! The app still works haha
- EDIT: Ok I like to do things properly. I fixed the misunderstood step!
